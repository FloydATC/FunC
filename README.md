FunC is a bytecode script language interpreter based on Bob Nystrom's "clox" language
as implemented in his work-in-progress book at craftinginterpreters.com

In addition to several of the "challenges" presented in that book,
I have added a lot of other language features.

HOWEVER! I am a self-taught hobbyist programmer still learning C and the code quality clearly reflects this fact.
